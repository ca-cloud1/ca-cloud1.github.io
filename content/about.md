# About me

Hi, my name is Claudia! Iâ€™m a MSc student in Earth and Atmospheric Science, with
a BSc in Environmental Sciences, Policy and Management. Here, I am documenting
my journey into data science, so thanks for coming along for the ride.

My career interests include: data-driven climate change solutions, renewable
energy and sustainability, public health, policy analysis, and international
relations.

Some hobbies of mine include snowboarding, hiking, and reading
